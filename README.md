# mypdiary
This is a simple flask website where you can sign up/login and write something just as you do in your diary so the name pdiary.

Live Running code at https://mypdiary.herokuapp.com/
Note: It may take some time to load the website because it is running on the free dyno of heroku

Please bear in mind that it's UI is not very greatðŸ˜… because I write this website while learning flask so I was not concerned with frontend.
